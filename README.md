Vue PWA
=======

A progressive web app built with Vue.js.


An Introduction to Vue
----------------------

At first, this project will walk through the process of
[getting started](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html#Getting-Started)
with Vue.js outlined in the [Introduction](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html) of the Guide.



Node on Express
---------------

The project was started using the default [`hello-express`](https://glitch.com/~hello-express) project on Glitch.

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
